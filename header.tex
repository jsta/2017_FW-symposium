%% If you have the Fira font installed, to actually have it used it 
%% via rmarkdown you need to declare it here 
%\setsansfont[ItalicFont={Fira Sans Light Italic},BoldFont={Fira Sans},BoldItalicFont={Fira Sans Italic}]{Fira Sans Light}
%\setmonofont[BoldFont={Fira Mono Medium}]{Fira Mono}

%% You can set various Metropolis options via \metroset{} here
%\metroset{....}

%% You can redefine colours, mostly by borrowing from Beamer
\setbeamercolor{frametitle}{bg=gray}

%% You also use hyperref, and pick colors 
\hypersetup{colorlinks,citecolor=orange,filecolor=red,linkcolor=brown,urlcolor=blue}

%% when rendered with rmarkdown, somehow the unicode char for the dot
%% disappears so we redefine it here -- that is an older comments, seems font-specific
%\renewcommand{\textbullet}{$\cdot$}
%\renewcommand{\itemBullet}{â–¸}   % unicode U+25b8 'black right pointing small triangle'

%% The institute macro puts a small line for affiliation at the bottom
%\institute{Institute of Institutionalism} 

%% We can also place a logo
%\titlegraphic{\hfill\includegraphics[height=1cm]{someLogo.pdf}}
